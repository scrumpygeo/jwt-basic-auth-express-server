# I. SETUP

1.  npm init

    - hit enter to everything.

2.  npm i --save express mongoose morgan body-parser
3.  create index.js

4.  `$ node index.js // to try run server when we got code.`

5.  his version of node isn't fully es16 so he uses require instead of import statements so we do it that way

6.  define port we will use on server:
    const port = process.env.PORT || 3090;

= if there is an environment var of port defined use that else 3090

7. make an instance of express:
   const app = express();

8. then const server = http.createServer(app);
   http is a native node library
   - it says make an server that knows how to receive requests and anything that comes in forward it to our express appln.

Now run server with `node index.js` and it works

9. add the app setup stuff (morgan & bodyparser middleware)
   morgan is a logging framework = good for debugging
   bodyParser parses incoming requests into json regardless of request type.

10. npm i --save nodemon
    nodemon watches our file dir for any change. Any changes and it restarts server.
    to do this add script to package.json
    "dev": "nodemon index.js"

    then run it with npm run dev

11. express route handler
    create file called router.js to hold it.

    - export a function from the file
    - import it into index.js server and pass app into that function
    - so everything in router is accessible to index
    - basic is like this:

    ```
    module.exports = function (app) {
    ```

    - routes are defined like this:

    ```
            app.get('/', function (req, res, next) {

            });
    ```

    req = request we get IN (to server)
    res = response
    next - for error handling

# II. AUTHENTICATION

Connection to DB.
Mongoose (= an ORM) = library sitting btween us and mongodb.

i. create user model with mongoose

- this model will represent a user.
  - has 2 attribs, email and pwd.

1. create new folder called models
   and in it user.js for the user model

Schema tells mongoose about the fields our model will have.

We will do this inside our user model:

      - Define our model
      - Create the model class
      - Export the model

Here, String ins the Javascript String so we don't need to import anything

```
const userSchema = new Schema({
  email: String,
  password: String,
});

```

to make sure username is unique we declare it like so: email: { type: String, unique: true, lowercase: true },
Mongodb does not enforce case check when doing unique check; ie it treats same email address, one lwr case and 1 in caps as different. So we need to add lowercase: true

then export it.

2. MongoDB Setup

- set it up outside. Run it with mongod command

Now write setup code in index.js to connect to mongodb:
require('mongoose') and look ad DB Setup section in index.js

```
// DB Setup
mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:auth/auth', {
  useNewUrlParser: true,
  useUnifiedTopology: true,
});
```

If u get any probs running mongod, make sure you are running it from cmd with admin rights.

3. Create user

i. in router, remove the test route we had and use this:
app.post('/signup', Authentication.signup);

```
  ii. authentication.js: do these 4 steps:
     - see if user exists
       - if user exists, return error
       - if user doesnt exist, create and save user record.
       - respond to request informing user was created
```

req.body: .body refers to anything contained in the post request
